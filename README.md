# CrapsWithBettingSystem
A simple Command Line Interface (CLI) Python "Craps" game I originally created in 2015 as a baseline for learning Python, I decided to go back through recently and update the code to be cleaner and more effective. Feel free to download and play with it as you learn the language.

Anyone is welcome to download, modify, and submit a pull request. Feel free to add issues as well.
